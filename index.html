    For both parts you should discuss the use of the effects (material properties, shading) that can be added to a scene
    and whether they are useful for the particular application.

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>The most useful effect in presenting molecular data is the use of colour for each element. Colour is a simple way to
                represent a dimension fourth to the data, and allows atoms to be easily found and mentally grouped by
                the user.
                Luckily there exists a standard colour scheme for elements, which makes developing and viewing such
                scenes
                significantly easier.</p>

            <p>The properties of the material, such as texture, reflectivity, shading etc. have little importance
                in this model as the
                concept of texture makes little sense for atoms. Even the use of shadows and lighting, which normally
                facilitate in the understanding of orientation are not particularly useful as this model is static
                and no bond rotation is occurring. Lighting does, however, contribute to the realism of the scene,
                allowing users to
                experience a more believable scene that may contribute to their spatial understanding.</p>
            <p>For interest's sake, here is an example of the same scene as above, but rendered without directional
                lighting:</p>

            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>In contrast to the previous scene, this brain model relies on using a texture on its 3 planes in order
                to convey its spatial information about the brain. As the MRI scans are in black and white, and because
                there is no additional dimension of data needed to be displayed, colour is not used in this scene.</p>
            <p>The MR images are displayed using a Phong material, which simulates a shiny surface, as on photo paper.
                This is not particularly important and indeed adds unnecessary strain on the renderer.
                However, as before, adding lighting effects adds some realism that seems to make the scene more
                accessible.</p>
